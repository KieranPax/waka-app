# WaKa App
A mobile webapp for learning japanese kanji &amp; vocabulary.


It uses the most upto date version of the WaniKani curriculum.

> *I do no claim to own the curriculum for this app, __only the code in this repository__.*

The curriculum is not included in the app until an API token is given.
*TODO: API token registration*

---

The app will feature a quiz function that lets users revise sets of radicals, kanji or vocabulary.

It uses Typescript, VueJS, Babel and some other stuff and will be compiled into a capacitor app (If I can figure that out).


I am not able to read japanese as this app is for the purpose of me learning japanese.
<!-- Later plans are:
 - A custom study mode.
 - Inclusion of the WaniKani SRS system, linked to the users account. -->
